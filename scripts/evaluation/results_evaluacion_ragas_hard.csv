SAR has the advantage of operating at wavelengths not impeded by cloud cover or lack of illumination.\nUnlike passive optical sensors that require the sun's illumination, an active SAR instrument transmits its own microwave signal to illuminate the Earth's surface at an angle. SAR actively transmits microwave signals towards the Earth and receives a portion of transmitted energy as backscatter from the ground. The returned backscatter echo of the scene is received by the instrument's antenna a short time later at a slightly different location, as the satellite travels along its orbit. The brightness amplitude of the returned signal, along with its phase information, is recorded to construct an image of the scene.\nThe SAR instrument provides radar backscatter measurements influenced by the terrain structure and surface roughness. Generally, the more roughness or structure on the ground, the greater the backscatter. Rough surfaces will scatter the energy and return a significant amount back to the antenna resulting in a bright feature. Flat surfaces reflect the signal away resulting in a dark feature. Likewise, more structurally complex targets such as forests will appear brighter as signal interaction with the leaves, branches and trunks will result in a higher proportion of the signal being transmitted back to the sensor.\nThe dielectric constant of the materials on the ground also play a factor in the measurements. In the microwave region of the spectrum, most natural materials have a dielectric constant in the range of 3 to 8 when dry, whereas water has a dielectric constant of approximately 80. The dielectric constant indicates the reflectivity and conductivity of materials. Therefore, the..."", 'Document: S1 Mission\nSection: S1 Mission > SAR Instrument > Polarimetry\nContent:\nCopernicus Sentinel-1 can collect several different images from the same series of pulses by using its antenna to receive specific polarisations simultaneously. Copernicus Sentinel-1 is a phase-preserving dual polarisation SAR system. It can transmit a signal in either horizontal (H) or vertical (V) polarisation, and then receive in both H and V polarisations. Dual polarisation Level-1 Single Look Complex (SLC) products contain complex values. In addition to the backscatter intensity that can be measured from each single polarisation, the inter-channel phase information allows to perform enhanced analysis of backscattering properties.\nTargets on the ground have distinctive polarisation signatures reflecting different polarisations with different intensities and converting one polarisation into another. For example, volume scatterers (e.g. forest canopy) have different polarisation properties than surface scatterers (e.g. sea surface). Polarimetric techniques such as polarimetric target decomposition (eigenvector-based, model-based, ...) allow the separation of different scattering contributions and can be used to extract information about the scattering process.

The key points are:

1. Sentinel-1 is a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mission that operates in the C-band microwave spectrum. It does not have any optical/multispectral imaging capabilities.

2. The documentation does not mention Sentinel-1 having a Red Edge band, which is a key spectral band used for monitoring vegetation health and chlorophyll content. Red Edge bands are typically found on optical/multispectral sensors like Sentinel-2.

3. The applications of Sentinel-1 discussed in the context focus on using SAR backscatter and polarimetric information for applications like forestry, agriculture, and land cover classification. There is no indication that Sentinel-1 can directly measure vegetation health parameters like the Red Edge.

4. The context states that the cross-polarization VH backscatter and the VH/VV polarization ratio are more sensitive to vegetation structure and water content, but these are not the same as a dedicated Red Edge band.

In summary, Sentinel-1 does not have the capability to detect vegetation health using a Red Edge band, as it is a SAR mission without any optical/multispectral imaging sensors. The vegetation-related applications of Sentinel-1 rely on the analysis of SAR backscatter and polarimetric properties, rather than spectral information from Red Edge or other optical bands.",No. Sentinel-1 is a Radar (SAR) satellite.

1. The Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) is described as measuring the Earth's reflected radiance in 13 spectral bands from the Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR) to the Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) wavelength regions. There is no mention of any Thermal Infrared bands.

2. The spectral band information provided in Document 6 lists the 13 Sentinel-2 MSI bands, which range from 443 nm to 2190 nm. This does not include any thermal infrared bands, which would typically be in the 8-14 μm wavelength region.

3. The applications and band combinations discussed in Document 9 also do not reference any Thermal Infrared bands or products from Sentinel-2.

- According to Document 4, following an anomaly to the instrument electronics power supply on December 2021, the Sentinel-1B satellite was unable to deliver radar data.
- The end of mission for Sentinel-1B was declared in July 2022, and the disposal activities were completed in September 2024.

- During the time frame from September 2022 to April 2025, the Sentinel-1 observation scenario was based solely on the Sentinel-1A satellite.
- Document 3 states that Sentinel-1C was successfully launched in December 2024 and became fully operational in early May 2025, re-establishing the 2-satellite Sentinel-1 constellation configuration with Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1C.

- Spatial Resolution: 5 m x 20 m (single look)

The IW mode captures data using the Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans SAR (TOPSAR) technique. This involves electronically steering the radar beam in the azimuth direction during each burst, in addition to the range steering, to achieve a more uniform image quality across the swath.

The IW mode is described as the ""main acquisition mode over land and satisfies the majority of service requirements."" It provides a good balance of wide swath coverage and reasonably high spatial resolution, making it suitable for a variety of land applications such as forestry, agriculture, and land cover monitoring.

1. Acquisition Pattern:
   - The Wave mode acquires data in small 20 km x 20 km ""vignettes"" at regular intervals of 100 km along the orbit.
   - The vignettes are acquired by alternating between near range (approximately 23° incidence angle) and far range (approximately 36° incidence angle) positions.
   - Vignettes on the same incidence angle are separated by 200 km.

2. Discontinuous Coverage:
   - The Wave mode acquisitions consist of these discrete vignettes, rather than a continuous swath.
   - Each vignette is processed as a separate image within the Wave mode product.
   - There are gaps between the individual vignettes, resulting in discontinuous ground coverage.

3. Limitations of the TOPSAR Technique:
   - The Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) and Extra Wide Swath (EW) modes use the TOPSAR technique to acquire data in a continuous strip.
   - However, the Wave mode does not use TOPSAR, as it requires individual looks with sufficient time separation, which cannot be achieved within the short dwell time of the Wave mode bursts.
   - The progressive scanning of TOPSAR results in too short of an inter-look time separation, preventing the generation of a continuous Wave mode image strip.

In summary, the Wave mode's acquisition pattern of discrete vignettes, separated by gaps, combined with the limitations of the TOPSAR technique, result in Sentinel-1 Wave mode products not providing a continuous image strip, but rather a series of individual vignette images within the product.","WV mode acquires data in small 'vignettes' of 20 km x 20 km spaced at 100 km intervals along the track to sample ocean waves, rather than a continuous strip.",0.9467813051041186,1.0,1.0,0.9999999999999997

The relative orbit number is not annotated in the product name, but it is annotated in the product manifest as described in the [product specification document](https://sentiwiki.copernicus.eu/web/document-library#Library-S1-PDS).\nThe relationship between relative and absolute orbit depends on the unit and is given by:\nS1-A: Relative Orbit Number = mod (Absolute Orbit Number orbit - 73, 175) + 1\nS1-B: Relative Orbit Number = mod (Absolute Orbit Number orbit - 27, 175) + 1\nS1-C: Relative Orbit Number = mod (Absolute Orbit Number orbit - 172, 175) + 5\nwhere ""mod"" refers to the modulo operation.\nThe formulas can be used for ascending and descending geometries, and are valid from the moment the satellite reaches its final orbit with the 12-day repeat. This final orbit is achieved few months after the launches and before the end of In Orbit Commissioning of the sensors. The formula is then applicable to all products made available to the users.\nThe formula for S1-D will be defined during S1-D commissioning phase.\n**Naming standard for data set files**\nWithin a product folder, measurement datasets and annotation datasets follow a similar naming convention, with lower case alphanumeric characters separated by a hyphen “-”.\n**Level-0 products**', 'Document: S1 Products\nSection: S1 Products > SAR Products Overview > SAR Naming Convention\nContent:\n**Figure 4: Sentinel-1 Naming standard for all data set files in the Level-0 products**\nFor further details regarding the naming elements refer to the [Level-0 Product Format Specification](https://sentiwiki.copernicus.eu/__attachments/1673968/S1PD.SP.00110.ATSR%20-%20Sentinel-1%20Level-0%20Product%20Format%20Specifications%202023%20-%203.1...\n**Level-1 and Level-2 products**\n\n**Figure 5: Sentinel-1 Naming standard for all data set files in the Level-1 and Level-2 products**\nFor further details regarding the naming elements refer to the [Product Specification](https://sentiwiki.copernicus.eu/__attachments/1673968/S1-RS-MDA-52-7441%20-%20Sentinel-1%20Product%20Specification%202023%20-%203.14.1.pdf?inst-v=0b38ac37-4dd6-44ba-865b-d9854aa106d8) document.\n**ETAD products**\nThere is only one NetCDF file in the ETAD product, which shares the same name as the ETAD SAFE product with the appropriate extension “.nc” but without the product unique ID.

From data in each acquisition mode, the Instrument Processing Facility (IPF) generates focused Level-1 Single Look Complex (SLC) products and Level-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) products.\nSAR parameters that vary with the satellite position in orbit, such as azimuth FM rate, Doppler centroid frequency and terrain height, are periodically updated to ensure the homogeneity of the scene when processing a complete data take. Similarly, products generated from WV data can contain any number of vignettes, potentially up to an entire orbit's worth.\nAll Level-1 products are geo-referenced and time tagged with zero Doppler time at the centre of the swath. Geo-referencing is corrected for the azimuth bi-static bias by taking into account the pulse travel time delta between the centre of the swath and the range of each geo-referenced point.\nA Level-1 product can be one of the following two types:  \nGRD products are further classified by resolution (Full, High or Medium).

It is designed to be high-quality Analysis Ready Data (ARD) compliant with the CEOS ARD for Land (CARD4L) NRB specification.\nThe product aims to complement the existing family of Copernicus Sentinel-1 products, which currently contains Level-1 Single Look Complex (SLC) and Ground Range Detected (GRD) products [[1](https://sentiwiki.copernicus.eu/web/s1-products#Ref_NRB_1)], by providing a flexible and easy to use data source particularly suited for non-expert users and easily exploitable for automated time series analysis in the context of modern cloud-based analysis platforms.\nAccording to the CARD4L definition [[2](https://sentiwiki.copernicus.eu/web/s1-products#Ref_NRB_2)], the products are _“processed to a minimum set of requirements and organized into a form that allows immediate analysis with a minimum of additional user effort. These products would be resampled onto a common geometric grid (for a given product) and would provide baseline data for further interoperability both through time and with other datasets.”_\n**Description**\nThe S1-NRB product contains radiometrically terrain corrected (RTC) gamma nought backscatter (γ0) processed from Single Look Complex (SLC) Level-1A data acquired in Stripmap (SM), Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) or Extra Wide Swath (EW) mode. Each acquired polarization is stored in an individual binary image file. In addition to the actual backscatter data, annotation image datasets (e.g., local incidence angle) are included to enable better interpretation of the backscatter data as well as to convert it to sigma-nought RTC.', 'Document: S1 Mission\nSection: S1 Mission > SAR Instrument > Polarimetry\nContent:\nCopernicus Sentinel-1 can collect several different images from the same series of pulses by using its antenna to receive specific polarisations simultaneously. Copernicus Sentinel-1 is a phase-preserving dual polarisation SAR system. It can transmit a signal in either horizontal (H) or vertical (V) polarisation, and then receive in both H and V polarisations. Dual polarisation Level-1 Single Look Complex (SLC) products contain complex values. In addition to the backscatter intensity that can be measured from each single polarisation, the inter-channel phase information allows to perform enhanced analysis of backscattering properties.\nTargets on the ground have distinctive polarisation signatures reflecting different polarisations with different intensities and converting one polarisation into another. For example, volume scatterers (e.g. forest canopy) have different polarisation properties than surface scatterers (e.g. sea surface). Polarimetric techniques such as polarimetric target decomposition (eigenvector-based, model-based, ...) allow the separation of different scattering contributions and can be used to extract information about the scattering process.

**Level-1 SLC (Single Look Complex):**
- Provides the full complex-valued radar signal, including both amplitude and phase information
- Maintains the original resolution and geometry of the SAR data
- Allows for advanced processing techniques like interferometry, polarimetry, and coherent change detection
- Has a higher spatial resolution compared to GRD products
- The resolution varies by acquisition mode:
  - Stripmap (SM): 1.7 x 4.3 m to 3.6 x 4.9 m
  - Interferometric Wide Swath (IW): 2.7 x 22 m to 3.5 x 22 m 
  - Extra Wide Swath (EW): 7.9 x 43 m to 15 x 43 m
  - Wave (WV): 2.0 x 4.8 m to 3.1 x 4.8 m

**Level-1 GRD (Ground Range Detected):**
- Provides the detected magnitude of the radar signal, without the phase information
- The data is projected to a ground range geometry, removing the inherent distortions of the SAR imaging process
- Has a lower spatial resolution compared to SLC products
- Available in different resolution classes:
  - Stripmap (SM): Full Resolution (FR, 9 x 9 m), High Resolution (HR, 23 x 23 m), Medium Resolution (MR, 84 x 84 m)
  - Interferometric Wide Swath (IW): HR (20 x 22 m), MR (88 x 87 m) 
  - Extra Wide Swath (EW): HR (50 x 50 m), MR (93 x 87 m)
  - Wave (WV): MR (52 x 51 m)
- Suitable for applications that do not require the full phase information, such as land cover mapping, change detection, and ocean monitoring

In summary, the SLC products preserve the full radar signal and are better suited for advanced SAR techniques, while the GRD products offer a lower resolution but more readily usable data for a wide range of Earth observation applications.",SLC (Single Look Complex) contains phase and amplitude information in slant range geometry. GRD (Ground Range Detected) contains only detected amplitude projected to ground range with phase information lost.,0.9626543209769582,1.0,1.0,0.9804074348155231

""To avoid truncation of negative values, the dynamic range of both Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B is shifted by a band-dependent constant radiometric offset called RADIO_ADD_OFFSET and defined in a configuration file. The new pixel value is computed as following:

Atmospheric Correction Bands:
- Band 1 (443 nm): For aerosol correction
- Band 9 (945 nm): For water vapor correction

Cirrus Detection Band:
- Band 10 (1374 nm): For cirrus cloud detection and removal

Specifically:

1. Atmospheric Correction Bands:
   - Band 1 (443 nm): This band is used for aerosol correction during the atmospheric correction process.
   - Band 9 (945 nm): This band is used for water vapor correction during the atmospheric correction process.

2. Cirrus Detection Band:
   - Band 10 (1374 nm): This band is used for the detection and removal of cirrus clouds during the atmospheric correction process.

The context states that the Sentinel-2 Atmospheric Correction (S2AC) algorithm uses Band 10 measurements to detect and remove cirrus clouds. It also mentions that the water vapor retrieval over land is performed using the Atmospheric Pre-corrected Differential Absorption (ADPA) algorithm, which is applied to Band 8a and Band 9.

It is worth noting that a modification of this mask occurred on 6 December 2016 to stop acquiring the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheet margins in Open-Loop mode as the OLTC commands over these steepest areas were not precise enough. This modification is illustrated in **Figure 19**.\n\n**Figure 18: Acquisition mode mask defined for Sentinel-3A from 6 December 2016 to 9 March 2019.

All regions within +/- 60° are monitored using open loop on-board tracking. For Sentinel-3A, this mask was in operation from 9 March 2019 to 7 November 2020.

The WV mode operates for up to a maximum duty cycle of 75 min per orbit.\nThe Copernicus Sentinel-1C-band SAR instruments supports operation in single polarisation (HH or VV) and dual polarisation (HH+HV or VV+VH), implemented through one transmit chain (switchable to H or V) and two parallel receive chains for H and V polarisation.\nSM, IW and EW products are available in single (HH or VV) or dual polarisation (HH+HV or VV+VH). WV is single polarisation only (HH or VV).\nThe primary mode over land is IW, with VV+VH polarisation: having the Interferometric Wide swath as the one main operational mode satisfies most current service requirements, avoids conflicts and preserves revisit performance, simplifies mission planning, decreases operational costs and builds up a consistent long-term archive.\nOver open ocean, the WV mode, with VV polarisation, is the main operational acquisition mode acquiring vignettes at regular intervals.\nEW mode is used primarily over selected European seas, Arctic and Southern Ocean areas, mainly for sea-ice monitoring services and maritime surveillance, with the capability to cover 400 km wide area at each data-take. SM mode is only used for small islands and on request for extraordinary events such as emergency management.\nFor each mode, it is possible to produce products at SAR Level-0, Level-1 SLC, Level-1 GRD and Level-2 OCN.\n\n**Figure 12: Sentinel-1 Acquisitions Swath Coverage.

Copernicus Sentinel-1 is a phase-preserving dual polarisation SAR system. It can transmit a signal in either horizontal (H) or vertical (V) polarisation, and then receive in both H and V polarisations. Dual polarisation Level-1 Single Look Complex (SLC) products contain complex values. In addition to the backscatter intensity that can be measured from each single polarisation, the inter-channel phase information allows to perform enhanced analysis of backscattering properties.\nTargets on the ground have distinctive polarisation signatures reflecting different polarisations with different intensities and converting one polarisation into another. For example, volume scatterers (e.g. forest canopy) have different polarisation properties than surface scatterers (e.g. sea surface). Polarimetric techniques such as polarimetric target decomposition (eigenvector-based, model-based, ...) allow the separation of different scattering contributions and can be used to extract information about the scattering process. Dedicated dual-Pol SAR classification techniques allow improved classification of point targets and distributed target areas.\nThe following RADARSAT-2 image of Flevoland in the Netherlands shows the difference in intensities from VH (left) and VV (centre). The composite RGB (colour) image on the right was created using the VV channel for red, VH channel for green and the ratio |VV| / |VH| for blue.\n\n**Figure 8: Intensities from different polarimetric channels [Credits: MDA and CSA]**', 'Document: S1 Applications\nSection: S1 Applications > Land Monitoring > Agriculture\nContent:\nMonitoring of crop conditions, soil properties and mapping tillage activities, help to assess land use, predict harvests, monitor seasonal changes and assist in implementing policy for sustainable development. Sentinel-1 can also be used for monitoring the changes of agricultural production and productivity of pastures caused by drought and monitoring the decline of land productivity and soil degradation due to excessive cultivation and pasturage and improper irrigation.\nAgricultural maps enable provision of independent and objective estimates of the extent of cultivation in a given country or growing season, which can be used to support efforts to ensure food security in vulnerable areas.\nBoth SLC and GRD products can be used for crop monitoring, depending on the parameter of interest. Typically, if the SAR intensity is preferred, then the GRD is the only product needed. However, if more information are necessary, polarimetric parameters are requested so SLC product should be selected.\nFor both product types, double polarisation shall be selected as cross-polarised VH backscatter is highly sensitive to changes in vegetation densities and structure and polarisation ratio VH/VV is sensitive to vegetation phenology or water content.\n\n**Figure 2: Monitoring of expansion of rubber plantation with Sentinel-2 / Sentinel-1.

The SM mode features (at a comparable system resource consumption) a smaller swath w.r.t the IW mode (in the order of 80 km vs 250 km) but ensures a higher spatial resolution, of particular interest for volcano monitoring._']","Based on the information provided in the Sentinel-1 mission documentation, the key differences between the resolution capabilities of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 are:

Sentinel-1 Resolution:
- Sentinel-1 operates in C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging mode
- It has multiple acquisition modes with different resolutions:
  - Stripmap (SM) mode: Down to 5 m resolution
  - Interferometric Wide-swath (IW) mode: Down to 5 m resolution
  - Extra-Wide (EW) swath mode: Down to 20 m resolution
  - Wave (WV) mode: 20 m resolution

Sentinel-2 Resolution:
- Sentinel-2 is a multi-spectral optical imaging mission
- It has 13 spectral bands with the following spatial resolutions:
  - 10 m resolution for the Blue, Green, Red and Near-Infrared bands
  - 20 m resolution for the Red Edge and Shortwave Infrared bands
  - 60 m resolution for the Coastal/Aerosol, Water Vapor and Cirrus bands

In summary, the key differences are:

1. Sensor Type:
   - Sentinel-1 uses Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging
   - Sentinel-2 uses multi-spectral optical imaging

2. Spatial Resolution:
   - Sentinel-1 can achieve higher spatial resolutions down to 5 m in its various imaging modes
   - Sentinel-2 has a maximum spatial resolution of 10 m for its highest resolution bands

3. Spectral Resolution:
   - Sentinel-1 is a single C-band radar instrument
   - Sentinel-2 has 13 spectral bands covering the visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared regions

So in general, Sentinel-1 provides higher spatial resolution imaging capabilities compared to Sentinel-2, but Sentinel-2 offers more detailed spectral information across a wider range of the electromagnetic spectrum.","Sentinel-1 (Radar) resolutions range from 5-40 m depending on mode.

[Credits: TAS-I]**\nThe spacecraft is a three-axis, stabilised satellite, yaw/pitch/roll steering (zero Doppler), characterised by sun, star, gyro and magnetic field sensors, a set of four reaction wheels dedicated to orbit and attitude control and three torque rods as actuators to provide steering capabilities on each axis. The satellite is equipped with two solar array wings capable of producing 5 900 W (at end of life) to be stored in a modular battery, the battery capacity is 324 Ah.\nThe satellite is based on the PRIMA (Piattaforma Italiana Multi Applicativa) bus, building on the experience gained from RADARSAT-2 and COSMO-SkyMed, which use the same bus. The bus provides highly accurate pointing knowledge (better than 0.004°) on each axis, high attitude accuracy (about 0.01° on each axis) and real-time orbit...\nThe reference orbit will be maintained within an Earth-fixed orbital tube of a diameter of 120 m (RMS) during normal operation.\nThe satellite platform provides features for the management of the attitude and orbit control systems, science data handling with storage capability of 1,410 Gb, propulsion, power, thermal control, spacecraft autonomy and failure detection identification and recovery, and communication with the ground via X-band data downlink and optical data link through EDRS for payload data at 520 Mbit/s; S-band 64 kbps uplink and 128 kbps / 2 Mbps downlink for TM/TC.\nThe total mass of the spacecraft at launch is approximately 2 300 kg (including 130 kg fuel).', ""Document: S1 Products\nSection: S1 Products > Level-1 Products\nContent:\nSentinel-1 Level-1 products are the baseline products for the majority of users from which higher levels are derived.

Similarly, products generated from WV data can contain any number of vignettes, potentially up to an entire orbit's worth.\nAll Level-1 products are geo-referenced and time tagged with zero Doppler time at the centre of the swath. Geo-referencing is corrected for the azimuth bi-static bias by taking into account the pulse travel time delta between the centre of the swath and the range of each geo-referenced point.\nA Level-1 product can be one of the following two types:  \nGRD products are further classified by resolution (Full, High or Medium).

Copernicus Sentinel-1 is a phase-preserving dual polarisation SAR system. It can transmit a signal in either horizontal (H) or vertical (V) polarisation, and then receive in both H and V polarisations. Dual polarisation Level-1 Single Look Complex (SLC) products contain complex values. In addition to the backscatter intensity that can be measured from each single polarisation, the inter-channel phase information allows to perform enhanced analysis of backscattering properties.\nTargets on the ground have distinctive polarisation signatures reflecting different polarisations with different intensities and converting one polarisation into another. For example, volume scatterers (e.g. forest canopy) have different polarisation properties than surface scatterers (e.g. sea surface). Polarimetric techniques such as polarimetric target decomposition (eigenvector-based, model-based, ...) allow the separation of different scattering contributions and can be used to extract information about the scattering process. Dedicated dual-Pol SAR classification techniques allow improved classification of point targets and distributed target areas.\nThe following RADARSAT-2 image of Flevoland in the Netherlands shows the difference in intensities from VH (left) and VV (centre).

This release of the S1GBM comprises two global mosaics describing the temporal mean of sigma nought backscatter s0(38, t) in VV- and VH-polarisation respectively.\nThe S1GBM supports the testing, design, and verification of upcoming radar sensors, related SAR-processor performance simulations, raw data compression optimisation, and visualisation purposes. It also presents a valuable environmental record for investigating the C-band VV/VH backscatter response over different land covers, and documenting the state of the land surface in 2016 and 2017.\n**Data Set Specifications**\nThe S1GBM VV and VH mosaics are georeferenced to the Equi7Grid and divided into six continental zones (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, South America), which are further divided into square tiles of 100 km extent (""T1""-tiles). The dataset is organised in 12 collections, one for each of the 6 continents and the 2 polarisations. In addition to the original data images, downsampled quicklook-files of same geographic extent are available for all tiles, allowing for a convenient preview of the data. With this setup, the S1GBM consists of 16,071 tiles over 6 continents, for VV and VH each, totalling to a data volume of 2.67 TB.\nThe tiles\' file-format is a LZW-compressed GeoTIFF holding 16-bit integer values, with tagged metadata on encoding and georeference.

The accuracy and stability numbers refer to measurement uncertainty of the...', 'Document: S1 Products\nSection: S1 Products > SAR Products Overview\nContent:\nThe Sentinel-1 C-band radar antenna beam illuminates the ground to the right side of the satellite. Due to satellite motion and the along track (azimuth) beam width of the antenna, each target element only stays inside the illumination beam for a short time. As part of the on-ground processing, the complex echo signals received during this time are added coherently. In this way a long antenna is synthesized, with the synthetic aperture length being equal to the distance the satellite traveled during the integration time. In principle, the along track resolution obtainable with SAR is approximately half the real antenna length. To enhance the radiometric resolution, multi-look azimuth processing can be employed and consequently, the along track resolution will be reduced by a factor equal to the look number. The across track or range resolution is a function of the transmitted radar bandwidth.\nThe fact that the system works coherently from end-to-end means that both the amplitude and the phase relationships between the complex transmitted and received signals are maintained throughout the instruments and the processing chain. This facilitates aperture synthesis as well as multi-pass radar interferometry using pairs of images taken over the same area at different times.\nThe Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument may acquire data in four exclusive modes:\n* Stripmap (SM). This is a standard SAR stripmap imaging mode where the ground swath is illuminated with a continuous sequence of pulses and with the antenna beam pointing to a fixed azimuth and elevation angle.\n* Interferometric Wide swath (IW). Data is acquired in three swaths using the Terrain Observation with Progressive Scanning SAR (TOPSAR) imaging technique. In IW mode, bursts are synchronised from pass to pass to ensure alignment of interferometric pairs.', 'Document: S1 Products\nSection: S1 Products > Related Production > **Sentinel-1 ARD Normalised Radar Backscatter (NRB) Product**\nContent:\nAll images are projected and gridded into the United States Military Grid Reference System (US-MGRS). Hence, the data is projected to Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS) at the poles and to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) otherwise. Tiling is applied to structure data into (1) UTM zones and (2) 100 x 100 km granules. The pixel spacing is 10 m for SM and IW, and 20 m for EW.\nThe use of the US-MGRS tile grid ensures a very high level of interoperability with Sentinel-2 Level-2A ARD products making it easy to also set-up complex analysis systems that exploit both SAR and optical data.\nIt should be noted that while speckle is inherent in SAR acquisitions, speckle filtering is not applied to the S1-NRB product in order to preserve spatial resolution. Some applications (or processing methods) may require spatial or temporal filtering for stationary backscatter estimates.\nAccurate Radiometric Terrain Correction (RTC) and Geometric Terrain Correction (GTC) is achieved utilising state-of-the-art algorithms [[3](https://sentiwiki.copernicus.eu/web/s1-products#Ref_NRB_3)].

1. Sentinel-1 is a C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mission, operating at a center frequency of 5.405 GHz (corresponding to a wavelength of ~5.55 cm).

2. The context does not mention Sentinel-1 having any altimetry capabilities. Sentinel-1 is focused on SAR imaging applications, not altimetry.

3. In contrast, Sentinel-3 is described as having an altimetry instrument, the Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter (SRAL). 

4. The context does not provide any information about the specific frequency band used by the Sentinel-3 SRAL altimeter. Altimetry missions typically use lower microwave frequencies, often in the Ku-band or Ka-band, which are more suitable for measuring sea surface height.

Sentinel-2 Spatial Resolution:
- According to the context, Sentinel-2 has 13 spectral bands with the following spatial resolutions:
  - 4 bands at 10 m resolution
  - 6 bands at 20 m resolution 
  - 3 bands at 60 m resolution
- The 10 m bands include the Near-Infrared (NIR) band (B8 at 842 nm) which is important for vegetation monitoring.
- The 20 m bands include several vegetation red-edge bands (B5, B6, B7, B8a) that are also useful for vegetation analysis.

Sentinel-3 OLCI Spatial Resolution:
- The context does not provide detailed information about the spatial resolution of the Sentinel-3 OLCI instrument.
- However, the context states that Sentinel-2 is a ""high-resolution, multi-spectral imaging mission"", implying that it has higher spatial resolution compared to other Sentinel missions.

Based on the information provided:

Sentinel-2 provides higher spatial resolution for vegetation monitoring compared to Sentinel-3 OLCI. Specifically, Sentinel-2 has 10 m and 20 m bands that are well-suited for detailed vegetation analysis, while the context does not specify the spatial resolution of Sentinel-3 OLCI.

The key advantages of Sentinel-2 for vegetation monitoring are:
- 4 bands at 10 m resolution, including the critical NIR band
- 6 bands at 20 m resolution, including specialized vegetation red-edge bands
- Higher overall spatial resolution compared to the unspecified resolution of Sentinel-3 OLCI

Due to satellite motion and the along track (azimuth) beam width of the antenna, each target element only stays inside the illumination beam for a short time. As part of the on-ground processing, the complex echo signals received during this time are added coherently. In this way a long antenna is synthesized, with the synthetic aperture length being equal to the distance the satellite traveled during the integration time. In principle, the along track resolution obtainable with SAR is approximately half the real antenna length. To enhance the radiometric resolution, multi-look azimuth processing can be employed and consequently, the along track resolution will be reduced by a factor equal to the look number. The across track or range resolution is a function of the transmitted radar bandwidth.\nThe fact that the system works coherently from end-to-end means that both the amplitude and the phase relationships between the complex transmitted and received signals are maintained throughout the instruments and the processing chain. This facilitates aperture synthesis as well as multi-pass radar interferometry using pairs of images taken over the same area at different times.\nThe Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument may acquire data in four exclusive modes:\n* Stripmap (SM). This is a standard SAR stripmap imaging mode where the ground swath is illuminated with a continuous sequence of pulses and with the antenna beam pointing to a fixed azimuth and elevation angle.\n* Interferometric Wide swath (IW). Data is acquired in three swaths using the Terrain Observation with Progressive Scanning SAR (TOPSAR) imaging technique. In IW mode, bursts are synchronised from pass to pass to ensure alignment of interferometric pairs.', 'Document: S1 Products\nSection: S1 Products > Level-1 Products > ETAD Products\nContent:\n**Figure 11: ETAD NetCDF structure.

[Credits: ESA]**\nThe azimuth resolution is reduced compared to SM due to the shorter target illumination time of the burst. Using the sweeping azimuth pattern, each target is seen under the same antenna pattern, independently from its azimuth position in the burst image. By shrinking the azimuth antenna pattern, as seen by a target on the ground, scalloping effects on the image can be reduced.\nThe Sentinel-1 C-SAR system is designed to enable TOPS burst synchronization of repeat-pass data-takes supporting the generation of TOPS interferograms and coherence maps. Specifically, for the IW and EW modes, the TOPS burst duration is 0.82 s and 0.54 s (worst case) respectively, with a requirement for achieving a synchronization of...\nIW SLC products contain one image per sub-swath and one per polarisation channel, for a total of three (single polarisation) or six (dual polarisation) images in an IW product.\nEach sub-swath image consists of a series of bursts, where each burst has been processed as a separate SLC image. The individually focused complex burst images are included, in azimuth-time order, into a single sub-swath image with black-fill demarcation in between. There is sufficient overlap between adjacent bursts and between sub-swaths to ensure continuous coverage of the ground as provided in GRD products. The images for all bursts in all sub-swaths are resampled to a common pixel spacing grid in range and azimuth while preserving the phase information.\n\n**Figure 14: IW SLC Bursts and Sub-Swaths**\nAfter burst and sub-swath merging, the full product can be created, as is the case for the GRDH products shown in **Figure 15**. The TOPSAR technique greatly reduces scalloping effects over conventional ScanSAR.', ""Document: S1 Products\nSection: S1 Products > Level-1 Products\nContent:\nSentinel-1 Level-1 products are the baseline products for the majority of users from which higher levels are derived. From data in each acquisition mode, the Instrument Processing Facility (IPF) generates focused Level-1 Single Look Complex (SLC) products and Level-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) products.\nSAR parameters that vary with the satellite position in orbit, such as azimuth FM rate, Doppler centroid frequency and terrain height, are periodically updated to ensure the homogeneity of the scene when processing a complete data take. Similarly, products generated from WV data can contain any number of vignettes, potentially up to an entire orbit's worth.\nAll Level-1 products are geo-referenced and time tagged with zero Doppler time at the centre of the swath. Geo-referencing is corrected for the azimuth bi-static bias by taking into account the pulse travel time delta between the centre of the swath and the range of each geo-referenced point.\nA Level-1 product can be one of the following two types:  \nGRD products are further classified by resolution (Full, High or Medium).

The Sentinel-1 products are sliced into smaller segments during processing, where each product slice is a stand-alone product that can be processed independently. For the IW mode, these slices are approximately 25 seconds in length.

The context states that ""Each GeoTIFF band within a product slice will be no larger than 2 GB. Since a product could contain several bands for swaths and polarisations, the overall product size could be much larger.""

Therefore, the maximum size of a standard Sentinel-1 IW SLC product is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that the size would depend on the number of bands and polarizations included in the product. However, each individual GeoTIFF band within the product slice will not exceed 2 GB in size.

In summary, the maximum size of a Sentinel-1 IW SLC product is not definitively specified, but the individual GeoTIFF bands within the product are limited to 2 GB each.

Does Sentinel-1 acquire data in ascending or descending passes?,"['Document: S1 Products\nSection: S1 Products > SAR Products Overview\nContent:\nThe Sentinel-1 C-band radar antenna beam illuminates the ground to the right side of the satellite. Due to satellite motion and the along track (azimuth) beam width of the antenna, each target element only stays inside the illumination beam for a short time. As part of the on-ground processing, the complex echo signals received during this time are added coherently. In this way a long antenna is synthesized, with the synthetic aperture length being equal to the distance the satellite traveled during the integration time. In principle, the along track resolution obtainable with SAR is approximately half the real antenna length. To enhance the radiometric resolution, multi-look azimuth processing can be employed and consequently, the along track resolution will be reduced by a factor equal to the look number. The across track or range resolution is a function of the transmitted radar bandwidth.\nThe fact that the system works coherently from end-to-end means that both the amplitude and the phase relationships between the complex transmitted and received signals are maintained throughout the instruments and the processing chain. This facilitates aperture synthesis as well as multi-pass radar interferometry using pairs of images taken over the same area at different times.\nThe Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument may acquire data in four exclusive modes:\n* Stripmap (SM). This is a standard SAR stripmap imaging mode where the ground swath is illuminated with a continuous sequence of pulses and with the antenna beam pointing to a fixed azimuth and elevation angle.\n* Interferometric Wide swath (IW). Data is acquired in three swaths using the Terrain Observation with Progressive Scanning SAR (TOPSAR) imaging technique.

1. Orbital Information:
   - Sentinel-1 is in a near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit with a 12-day repeat cycle and 175 orbits per cycle for a single satellite.
   - Both Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B share the same orbit plane with a 180° orbital phasing difference. This means they are in the same orbit but offset by 180 degrees, allowing for a 6-day exact repeat cycle when both satellites are operational.

2. Geographical Coverage:
   - The Sentinel-1 constellation offers coverage over the entire globe, with the revisit rate varying based on latitude.
   - At the equator, the revisit time is around 3 days, while at higher latitudes (e.g., the Arctic) the revisit time is less than 1 day.
   - This is due to the varying orbit track spacing, which is significantly greater at higher latitudes compared to the equator.

3. Observation Scenario:
   - The Sentinel-1 mission implements a baseline pre-defined observation scenario that systematically processes and disseminates data acquired in Interferometric Wide swath (IW), Extra Wide swath (EW), and Stripmap (SM) modes.
   - The observation scenario includes both ascending and descending passes, as shown in the provided figures (Figures 20 and 21).

In summary, the Sentinel-1 mission acquires data in both ascending and descending passes, with the revisit time and coverage varying based on latitude.

The key points are:

1. SLSTR Mission and Objectives:
   - The main objectives of the Sentinel-3 mission and the SLSTR instrument are to measure sea surface temperature, land surface temperature, ocean and land surface color, and support applications like ocean forecasting, environmental monitoring, and climate monitoring.
   - There is no mention of SLSTR being capable of measuring cloud vertical structure.

2. SLSTR Instrument Specifications:
   - The SLSTR instrument is a dual-view scanning temperature radiometer, with spectral channels in the visible, shortwave infrared, and thermal infrared regions.
   - The instrument specifications focus on parameters relevant for surface temperature measurements, such as spatial resolution, radiometric accuracy, and revisit times.
   - There are no details provided about SLSTR's capabilities for cloud vertical profiling or cloud height retrieval.

3. SLSTR Applications and Products:
   - The documented applications of SLSTR data include land mapping and monitoring, maritime monitoring, and atmospheric/climate monitoring.
   - The SLSTR products described are focused on land surface temperature, sea surface temperature, active fire detection, and other geophysical parameters related to the Earth's surface.
   - There is no information about SLSTR producing cloud vertical structure or cloud height data products.

In conclusion, the Sentinel-3 SLSTR instrument is not designed or intended for measuring cloud vertical structure. The documentation does not indicate that SLSTR has any capabilities for cloud height or cloud profile retrieval. The SLSTR is optimized for surface temperature measurements and does not appear to have the necessary spectral bands, viewing geometries, or algorithms to provide cloud vertical structure information. Users interested in cloud vertical structure should look to other satellite instruments and missions that are specifically designed for that purpose.","No, SLSTR is a radiometer for surface temperature. Cloud vertical structure is typically measured by active instruments like the Cloud Profiling Radar (EarthCARE) or LIDAR, not SLSTR.",0.30555555554537034,1.0,1.0,0.8681420236279725

   - The NRT product also includes a Restituted platform data file.

The context does not provide any specific details on the typical latency for the Sentinel-3 NRT products. However, the ""Near Real-Time"" designation implies that these products are generated and made available with a relatively short latency, likely within a few hours of data acquisition.

The document states that the Sentinel-3 POD products are divided into three categories based on timeliness - NRT, Short Time Critical (STC), and Non Time Critical (NTC). This suggests that the NRT products have the shortest latency compared to the other two categories.

Unfortunately, the provided context does not quantify the typical latency for the Sentinel-3 NRT products. The documentation does not specify the exact time frame for when these NRT products are generated and made available to users.
